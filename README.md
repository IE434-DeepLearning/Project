## Project Description:

The project is based on the dataset provided by the Department of Buildings ([DOB](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a)) 
for the City of New York. 
The data file is about 1.41 GB and is updated daily. It has 60 columns and about 4 million rows. 
It records all the information that is related to the permit application for construction and demolition activities in New York City. 
The data type includes numeric, categorical,time-based, textual classes. 
From the information in the column descriptions, our project scope might include performing exploratory data analysis to find interesting results, 
predicting the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and predicting whether the application is approved.
